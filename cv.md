### About me
Since I was young, I have always been intrigued by the exact sciences, particularly mathematics and computer science. It is not surprising that I decided to get a degree in these fields at the Belarusian State University, in particular, at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics.

I am currently in my third year of studies, specializing in designing software and hardware systems. During my time here, I have had the opportunity to write programs in various languages, including C++. It has been a challenging yet rewarding experience to work on complex software systems that solve real-world problems.

I have also had the chance to work with Verilog, VHDL, and assembler languages. Though they were daunting at first, I have come to appreciate the unique challenges and benefits that each language offers.

As much as I love working with software and hardware, I am always eager to learn something new. Lately, I have been exploring the world of frontend development, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am excited about the visual results that frontend development can offer and the endless possibilities it provides for my growth.
